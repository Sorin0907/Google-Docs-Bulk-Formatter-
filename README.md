## 💡 Motivation

These scripts were developed during my Level 4 Software Development Apprenticeship. The need came while working on my EPA project, where after I finished the write up, I decided to change the formatting for certain words that were highlighted with a different font and realised that Google Docs does not offer that feature. To change formatting for over 300 words is just BORING and time consuming. So I just decided to use the time to learn something new.
